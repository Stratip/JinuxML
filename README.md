# JinuxML
JinuxML is my free, open source machine learning framework built for learning.
I'm making this so I can muck around with low-level matrix and tensor operations
while also learning how to write an API.

## Coming Soon / TODO:
- Documentation
- Full README
- Usage Examples
- Python API
- High-level API like Keras' [Sequential](https://keras.io/api/models/sequential/)
- GPU Compute with (Vulkan, CUDA and OpenCL)
- Interop with existing libs like NumPY (after having a crude Python API working)

## Build Instructions:
```sh
# Coming Soon! (UwU)
```

## Project Layout:
- *src/*: API source files and private headers.
- *include/*: Public API headers.
- *tests/*: Unit tests. (None yet)
- *examples/*: Usage examples. (None yet)
- *tools/*: Developer tools for JinuxML. (None yet)
- *docs/*: API documentation for (currently) C++ and (in the future) Python. (None yet)
- *main.cpp*: Temporary testing file (Will be removed soon)
